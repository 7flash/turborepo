# Turborepo Documentation

<Features page="docs" detailed={false} />

Turborepo is a blazing fast build system for JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos - codebases containing multiple projects in a single, unified repository.

## The problem

Monorepos have many advantages - but **they struggle to scale**. Each repository you add has its own test suite, its own build process and its own pipeline. A single monorepo might have **hundreds of tasks to perform**.

## The solution

**Turborepo speeds up your monorepo**. Our remote cache stores the result of all your tasks, meaning that **your CI never needs to do the same work twice**.

Task scheduling can be a nightmare in a monorepo. Imagine `yarn build` needs to run before `yarn test`, across 40 workspaces. Turborepo **can schedule your tasks for maximum speed**, across all available cores.

Turborepo can be **adopted incrementally**. It uses the `package.json` scripts you've already written, the dependencies you've already declared, and a single `turbo.json` file. You can **use it with any package manager**, like `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`. You can add it to any monorepo in just a few minutes.

## Features

- **Incremental builds**: Building once is painful enough, Turborepo will remember what you (or your CI) built and skip work that's already been done.
- **Parallel execution**: Execute builds using every core at maximum parallelism without wasting idle CPUs.
- **Remote caching**: Share a cloud build cache across your organisation for faster builds on CI/CD.
- **Zero runtime overhead**: Turborepo doesn't interfere with your runtime code or touch your sourcemaps.

## What turborepo is not

Monorepos need to do two things in order to work:

1. **A package installer**: to install packages into `node_modules` and link workspaces together
1. **A task runner**: to run tasks

Turborepo **doesn't handle package installation**. Tools like `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn` already do that brilliantly. But they run tasks inefficiently, meaning slow CI builds.

We recommend that **Turborepo runs your tasks**, and your favourite package manager installs your packages.
